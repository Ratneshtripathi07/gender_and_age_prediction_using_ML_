# Gender and age Prediction from Images

## Overview
This project Utilizes PyTorch and OpenCV to detect and predict. copy the path of the img to the model and execute `detect_face.py`.

## Dependencies
To run this project, the following dependencies are required on your local machine:
1. PyTorch
2. OpenCV

## How to Run

1. **Insert the Path to the Model**
   - Before running the script, ensure you have the model file path correctly set in your code or environment.

2. **Run `detect_face.py`**
   - Execute the `detect_face.py` script to start the age and gender prediction process.

## Additional Information
- Ensure that your environment has the necessary permissions and libraries installed.
- For best results, use high-quality images with clear facial features.
